Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—storage, servers, databases, software—over the internet. Unlike traditional methods requiring physical infrastructure, the cloud allows on-demand access, enabling scalability and cost-efficiency. Key models include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Benefits include flexibility, improved collaboration, and disaster recovery. Businesses can avoid upfront hardware costs, pay-as-they-go, and focus on innovation. Popular providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure dominate the market. Security remains a concern, prompting advancements in encryption and monitoring. Cloud computing continues to revolutionize industries, making digital transformation more accessible than ever.
