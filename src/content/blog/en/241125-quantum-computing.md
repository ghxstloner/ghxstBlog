Quantum computing uses principles of quantum mechanics to process information, offering exponential performance gains for specific problems. Unlike classical computers, which use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, capable of superposition and entanglement. This allows simultaneous computations, making quantum systems powerful for optimization, cryptography, and drug discovery. Current quantum computers are in early stages, with companies like IBM and Google leading development. Challenges include maintaining qubit stability and error correction. While practical applications are years away, progress accelerates annually. Understanding quantum computing requires a new paradigm in thinking, promising to solve problems once deemed insurmountable in conventional computing.
