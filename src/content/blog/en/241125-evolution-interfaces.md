User interfaces have evolved from text-based command lines to visually rich and intuitive designs. In the 1980s, interfaces like DOS required typing commands, creating steep learning curves. The 1990s introduced graphical user interfaces (GUIs), making technology accessible with icons and windows. Touch interfaces revolutionized the 2000s, ushering in the smartphone era. Today, advancements in AR/VR promise immersive experiences, blending digital and real-world interactions. Designers now prioritize user-centric approaches, focusing on simplicity and accessibility. Interfaces evolve to match user expectations and technological capabilities, ensuring seamless interactions in increasingly complex systems. The future of UIs will likely emphasize natural language and gestures.
