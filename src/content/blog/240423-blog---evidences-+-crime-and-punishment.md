## My Journey in English Software Analysis and Development

Throughout my studies in Software Analysis and Development, I engaged in numerous tasks that greatly enhanced my learning. These tasks ranged from technical assignments to creative projects.

<h3 align="center">Brochure creation</h3>

One of the memorable projects was designing a brochure. This task not only honed my technical skills but also allowed me to creatively present information.

I cannot provide links to all the videos as I previously had them stored in the cloud provided by the tool *<span style="color:purple;">ClipChamp</span>*. They changed their policy, which resulted in all my videos being deleted ðŸ˜¢.


**Exploring Multimedia**

In addition to written tasks, I frequently recorded audio and video, which helped me refine my communication skills and technical proficiency.

**Video Introductions**

My first video project was an introduction video where I presented myself to my peers and instructors.

**Personal Reflections**

I also created videos discussing various personal topics. One such video featured me talking about someone very special to me, my girlfriend.

**Exploring My Roots**

Another video was dedicated to my hometown, which allowed me to share my background and cultural heritage with my audience.

Each of these projects not only contributed to my academic growth but also allowed me to explore different mediums of expression, making my educational journey enriching and diverse.

## "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky: A Dark and Psychological Journey

<p align="center">

</p>

Regarded as a grim novel, *Crime and Punishment* is imbued with deep psychological insights and portrays the wretched lives of the lowest dregs of society. Understanding the plot and the profound messages of the book is essential for any cultured individual.

Rodion Raskolnikov, a destitute student, desperately seeks to escape his own squalor. In a bid to change his fortunes, he resolves to murder an old pawnbroker, believing this act could elevate him from his misery. However, the aftermath of his crime plunges him into profound guilt. Tormented by his actions, he eventually confesses and resignedly heads to prison.

Raskolnikov, who had to abandon his university studies due to financial constraints, wanders the grimy, dim streets of 19th-century Saint Petersburg. As he contemplates his bleak circumstances, he divides humanity into two categories: the 'ordinary' and the 'extraordinary.' Believing himself to be extraordinary, he feels compelled to prove it through a significant act. This leads him to the chilling decision that murdering the old pawnbroker would be a justified means to alter his destiny.

While contemplating this imminent crime, Raskolnikov encounters Semyon Marmeladov, a drunken former official whose life story is marked by tragedy and loss. Marmeladov shares his sorrowful tale: his first wife died, he lost his job, and his daughter resorted to prostitution to support their family. Moved by Marmeladovâ€™s plight, Raskolnikov gives him the last of his moneyâ€”ironically, the same money he just received from the pawnbroker.

Soon after, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother. She writes that his sister is considering marriage to a wealthy suitor, hoping to secure Raskolnikov's future and enable him to complete his education. Unable to bear the thought of his sister sacrificing herself to a loathsome man she does not love, Raskolnikov becomes convinced that the only way to save his family is to follow through with his grim plan.

Thus, he commits the murder, striking the old woman with an axe. Unplanned, he also kills her half-sister who returns unexpectedly. In a panic, he grabs whatever money he can find and flees the scene.

The following day, Raskolnikov falls ill with fever. A police summons, which he fears is for the murder but turns out to be for unpaid rent, only heightens his paranoia. Just as he is about to leave the police station, overhearing officers discuss the murder causes him to faint. In his nervous state, he buries the stolen items.

The narrative takes another turn when Raskolnikov learns of Marmeladov's death in an accident. He donates his remaining money to Marmeladov's widow. Eventually, he meets Sonia, Marmeladov's daughter, who invites him to her father's funeral, marking the beginning of a significant relationship.

## "Critical Thinking and Media Literacy: Navigating Modern Challenges"

In an age where information is ubiquitous and the ability to discern truth from falsehood is more critical than ever, the skills of critical thinking and media literacy stand as foundational competences for all engaged citizens. This entry explores the essence of these skills and their pivotal role in our daily interactions with media.

**The Importance of Critical Thinking**

Critical thinking involves the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment. It is not just a skill, but a habit developed through consistent practice and application. It empowers individuals to analyze arguments, solve problems systematically, and understand the logical connection between ideas.

**Understanding Media Literacy**

Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of communication. In today's digital age, it is crucial for navigating the complex and often misleading landscape of modern media. This includes understanding how media messages shape our culture and society, recognizing bias in media, and discerning between what is real and what is fake.

**Challenges and Solutions**

One of the major challenges today is the prevalence of misinformation and biased information in various media outlets. To combat this, individuals must apply critical thinking to not take information at face value but to question its source and seek corroboration. By enhancing media literacy, we equip ourselves with the tools to recognize bias, identify propaganda, and differentiate between evidence-based information and speculation.

## My Work Experience in Programming

In my current position, I've had the unique opportunity to engage in real-world programming challenges, specifically working on an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This experience has marked my first foray into professional programming and has been both challenging and immensely educational.

### Working with Wamp Server

At the core of my development environment is the Wamp server, an internal server that has been crucial for local testing and development. Wamp, which stands for Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, allows me to manage and test the ERP software effectively. I am currently utilizing PHP version 5.6 and MySQL version 5.7, which, despite being older versions, remain robust for the needs of our complex ERP system.

### Challenges in ERP System Development

The ERP system I'm working on is vast and intricate, containing an overwhelming amount of data. This complexity is not just in the size of the software but also in the nature of the problems we need to solve. Managing such a large scale system requires not only a solid understanding of programming principles but also an ability to navigate and optimize large databases and ensure seamless integration across various modules.

### Learning and Growth

This role has been my first exposure to solving practical, real-world programming problems. It has pushed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, enhancing my debugging skills, and deepening my understanding of software architecture. Every day presents new challenges and learning opportunities, from optimizing SQL queries to enhancing PHP functions for better performance.

Working with such a complex system has taught me the importance of clean, maintainable code and has given me a profound appreciation for the intricacies of software development in a corporate environment.

</p>
As a passionate gamer, my all-time favorite game has to be League of Legends. It's not just a game for me; it's a virtual arena where skills are tested, strategies are formed, and epic battles unfold.

### Why I Love Playing Yone

Among the vast roster of champions, Yone, the Unforgotten, stands out as my main. Yone's lore, dual swords, and unique abilities make him not just a fun champion to play but a symbol of balance and power. His backstory of seeking redemption and battling his inner demons adds depth to his character, making every match an extension of his story.

Yone's kit offers a blend of magic and swordplay, which perfectly suits my playstyle. Executing his combo of abilities feels fluid and rewarding, especially when turning the tides of battle with his ultimate.

</p>

Each game as Yone is a new challenge, a new opportunity to refine strategies and sharpen skills. Whether it's solo duels or team fights, playing as Yone is a thrilling experience that never gets old.

League of Legends has not just been a game for me, but a journey into a richly crafted world that continues to evolve and surprise. Playing as Yone has enhanced this experience, making each session on the Fields of Justice a memorable saga.
